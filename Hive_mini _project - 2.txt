Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
 
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

-> To load the data in to the following table

hive>load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/hive_mini_project_2/Parking_Violations_Issued_-_Fiscal_Year_2017.csv' into table parking_violations_issued; 


Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.
->To consider the year 2017 i have created a seperate table for the year 2017

year(Issue_Date) = '2017';


Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
   ANS : Hive>select count(distinct summons_number) as No_Tickets  ,year(issue_date) as year from parking_violations_issued_2017 group by year(issue_date);

2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
   ANS : Hive>select count(distinct Registration_State) as Unique_state_count from parking_violations_issued_2017;

3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
   ANS : Hive>select count(distinct summons_number) as Tickets_without_address from parking_violations_issued_2017 where Street_code1 = 0 or Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;


Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
   ANS : Hive>select count(Violation_Code) as frequency_of_violation,Violation_Code from parking_violations_issued_2017 group by Violation_Code order by frequency_of_violation desc limit 5;


2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
   ANS : hive>select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number)as frequency_of_parking_ticket  from parking_violations_issued_2017 group by Vehicle_Body_Type order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5; 

3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
   ANS : hive>select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017  group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;

    

5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
   ANS : hive> create view vw_parking_violations_2017_partitioned_bins partitioned on (Violation_Code) as

when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 2 
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 3

7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)
    ANS : hive>select Violation_Time_bin, count(*) TicketsIssued from vw_parking_violations_2017_partitioned_bins where Violation_Code in (21, 37, 38,36) 
group by Violation_Time_bin order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;


8.) Letâ€™s try and find some seasonality in this data
      a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))
      b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.

Note: Please ensure you make necessary optimizations to your queries like selecting the appropriate table format, using partitioned/bucketed tables. Marks will be awarded for keeping the performance also in mind.
